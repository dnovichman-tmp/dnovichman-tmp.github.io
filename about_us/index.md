title: About Us
---
We are a group of enthusiasts who want to develop software that can combine the capabilities of all the GIS software and make available the resulting software as open source and customisable. In addition, we also want to solve some of the most basic GIS problems in the developing world. Problems such as city planning, land digitisation, efficient taxation and many more.
