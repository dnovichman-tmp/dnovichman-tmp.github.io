To develop a GIS mobile and desktop framework that helps resolve many navigation and GIS problems in the developing world. Furthermore, our software can be used by any one doing GIS work. The software and mobile applications are free (see licence below) but can be streamlined for a specific purposes.

##### Background
All across Africa from The Gambia to Somalia, from Cairo to Cape Town, there is a lack of proper urban and rural  planning. This has caused the congestion of our cities which usually manifest itself in the form of slums, shortage of government facilities such as hospitals, schools, police stations etc. In addition, this has also lead to lack of a proper mechanism for tax collection for lands and buildings as such has lead to significant loss of revenue for authorities. Though it has already started to manifest itself in the form of flooding, if proper planning is not carried out, we will face similar sanitary problems like India in the near future.

##### Description
The Planning and Mapping System consists of a desktop application (Linux and Windows) and an Android and iOS applications interconnected by a cloud service which hosts the databases and slave software. The mobile application can be used for navigation, display of important places nearby and can be used to create addresses, roads and lands for all fourteen districts. The desktop software while it can do all these, it comes with the analysis package and output the results in standard csv, KML and shapefiles. These outputs can be used in other software like ESRI, Google Earth etc. The desktop application can report land encroachment, costs, values and elevation maps of lands and roads and other information that can be used by stakeholders. In addition, this software also has our city planning algorithm for new and inhabited parts of a district. The algorithm uses terrain elevation profile, number of schools, hospitals etc per inhabitants, value of current structures etc to come up with a planned city thereby meeting the challenges of a sustainable city.
