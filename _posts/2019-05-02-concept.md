To develop a GIS mobile and desktop framework that helps resolve many navigation and GIS problems in the developing world. Furthermore, our software can be used by GIS experts, tax collectors, city planners and many others. The desktop software and mobile applications are free and released under the terms of BSD (see licence below). However, both the mobile apps and desktop software can be customised for specific purposes.

##### Background
All across Africa from The Gambia to Somalia, from Cairo to Cape Town, there is a lack of proper urban and rural  planning. This has caused the congestion of our cities which usually manifest itself in the form of slums, shortage of government facilities such as hospitals, schools, police stations etc. In addition, this has also lead to a lack of proper mechanism for tax collection for lands, residential homes and businesses. As such, this has lead to a significant loss of revenue for authorities. Though it has already started to manifest itself in the form of recurrent flooding of Freetown, Sierra Leone, if proper planning is not carried out, we will face similar sanitary problems like those faced in other developing countries in the near future.

##### Description
The Planning and Mapping System consists of a desktop application (Linux and Windows) and an Android and iOS applications interconnected by cloud services which host the databases and web based APIs. The mobile applications can be used for navigation, display of important places nearby, display of weather and can be used to create addresses, roads and lands for any geographical or political region. The desktop software while it can do all these, it comes with the analysis package and outputs the results in standard csv, KML, shapefiles and other standard GIS formats. These outputs can be used in other software like ESRI's ArcGIS, Google Earth etc. The desktop application can report land encroachment, costs, values and elevation maps of lands and roads and other information that can be used by stakeholders. In addition, this software also has our city planning algorithm for new (uninhabited) and inhabited parts of a region. The algorithm uses terrain elevation profile, number of schools, hospitals etc per inhabitants, value of current structures etc as constraints to come up with a planned city that meets the challenges of a sustainable city.
